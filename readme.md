# Stencilx

Support commands for the Stencil CLI

## Getting Started

```
npm install -g stencilx
```

### Use

Pull and unzip the current theme of a store. To use the Themes API, the store hash is required - so you will be prompted to enter it in initially. This will update the .stencil file so you won't have to enter it in continually. From the themes directory:

```
stencilx pull
```
